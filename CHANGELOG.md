### 🚀 Initial Release: An Architecture-Level AI Harness

This release establishes Architecture Compiler as an architecture-level AI harness: a deterministic compiler, a curated pattern registry, and three workflow skills that let humans and agents move from requirements to approved architecture and implementation with an explicit contract.

### 🧠 The Architecture Harness Philosophy
- **The Registry is the Trajectory:** Phil Schmid's thesis—"competitive advantage is the trajectories your harness captures"—applied to architecture. Our 180+ pattern registry is the accumulated trajectory of architectural intelligence that future agents inherit.
- **Deterministic Kernel:** An architecture compiler with **zero LLM inference** at its core. It serves as the kernel of the architecture harness, enforcing policy through hard NFR validation and include-based filtering.
- **Defendable AI Decisions:** Moves away from "vibe coding" to reproducible, auditable architectural artifacts (`architecture.yaml`, `selected-patterns.yaml`) that humans and agents can defend.

### ✨ Key Capabilities
- **Progressive Refinement:** An iterative workflow that translates requirements into machine-readable canonical specifications. (Requirements capture is pluggable — Superpowers, Gstack, Compound Engineering, or custom skill.)
- **Multi-Phase Filtering:** Hard validation against targets for Availability, Latency, Throughput, and Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
- **Cost Intent:** Three explicit modes — `optimize-tco` (balance CapEx/OpEx), `minimize-opex` (monthly costs), `minimize-capex` (one-time setup).
- **Conflict Resolution Engine:** Automated resolution based on match scores and declared cost intent.
- **Full TCO Analysis:** Cost feasibility checking across Pattern OpEx, one-time CapEx, and operational labor costs.
- **Explainable Infrastructure:** Verbose mode (`-v`) provides inline annotations for every spec field, turning the repo into a "living architectural contract."

### 🤖 AI-Native Governance (The Workflow Skills)
The release introduces three workflow skills:
- **`using-arch-compiler`:** Routes work to the correct workflow and sends it back for recompilation when architectural decisions change.
- **`compiling-architecture`:** Guides agents through requirements capture, deterministic pattern selection, approval, and re-approval.
- **`implementing-architecture`:** Ensures implementation strictly follows the approved architectural contract.
- **Immutable Schemas and Registry Boundaries:** Protection of core spec and pattern contracts to prevent agentic drift.

### 📦 The Pattern Registry (180+ Patterns)

- **Compliance:** `compliance-*`
- **Storage:** `db-*`, `data-*`
- **Caching:** `cache-*`, `caching-*`, `write-*`
- **Communication:** `api-*`, `sync-*`, `async-*`, `queue-*`
- **Reliability:** `resilience-*`, `consistency-*`, `distributed-*`, `exactly-*`, `saga-*`
- **Application:** `cqrs-*`, `event-*`, `crud-*`, `multi-*`, `tenancy-*`, `batch-*`, `genai-*`
- **Front-end:** `ui-*`
- **Observability:** `obs-*`, `ops-*`, `finops-*`
- **Delivery:** `deploy-*`, `release-*`, `build-*`, `dev-*`, `test-*`, `gof-*`
- **Governance:** `gov-*`

### 🛠️ Developer & Audit Tools
- **`archcompiler.py`:** The core 3,700+ line compilation engine.
